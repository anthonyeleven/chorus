# Standalone version

Packs [proxy](../proxy), [worker](../worker), [embedded redis](https://github.com/alicebob/miniredis), and webUI into single binary.
Standalone version does not have persistence, so it cannot be used for production, but it allows to run chorus locally without dependencies.

## Installation and usage

[See docs](https://docs.clyso.cloud/docs/products/chorus/installation#standalone)
